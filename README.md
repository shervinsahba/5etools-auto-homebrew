# Instructions
- Add desired homebrew to `homebrew_urls` in the format `<desired_filename.json> <url>`. The desired filename is just to save it with a clean name, but it's necessary in the script as is. Each homebrew name and source should be on a newline.
- Edit the `homebrew_dir` variable if needed.
- Clone the git repo to your instance of 5etools and run `import.sh`.
